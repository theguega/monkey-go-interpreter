An Interpreter written in Go for the Monkey programming language

## Reference

[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)

## Intent

This is a simple interpreter for the Monkey programming language.

My intention is to learn how to write an interpreter to understand the behavior and also being able to compare each step of the process with modern interpreters.

To run the interpreter, simply run `go run src/main.go` in the terminal.
